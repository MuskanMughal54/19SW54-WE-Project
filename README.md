# 19SW54-WE-Project
Hello, MUSKAN 19SW54 here. I have individually worked on WE Project and developed the web platform "MUALIJ" with user-friendly, responsive interface with database connectivity. For more Information please visit the project documentation here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vqLofkG17VQBZbv_S3G6VmRZdksFconEqZvYpmuJW0o/edit?usp=sharing


***INTRODUCTION***
Mualij is a web platform set to revolutionize the way patients schedule and manage their medical appointments, making it easier and more convenient for them to access the care they need, when they need it. Through its user-friendly interface and cutting-edge technology, Mualij is poised to become the go-to solution for patients seeking reliable and efficient medical appointment scheduling services.

***PROJECT INSTALLATION GUIDE***
To begin, it is necessary to install Visual Studio Code, which is a widely used integrated development environment (IDE) that supports multiple programming languages and platforms.
Next, you will need to install the JavaScript extension for Visual Studio Code, which provides support for its associated frameworks and libraries. In addition, you will need to install ReactJS, which is a popular and powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
To install ReactJS, you will also need to download and install Node.js, which is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that enables the execution of JavaScript code outside of a web browser.
Finally, to enable database connectivity for MUALIJ, you will need to install MySQL Workbench, which is a powerful and intuitive tool for managing and querying MySQL databases. 
Overall, the installation of MUALIJ involves a combination of software packages and tools, all of which are essential for the proper functioning of the application. By following the steps outlined above, you will be able to set up MUALIJ on your device and start using it to streamline your medical appointment booking process.


****PROJECT USAGE GUIDE*****
To use MUALIJ, install Visual Studio Code, place necessary folders in the correct hierarchy, enable ReactJS and Node.js, and initialize packages with the command "npm start." Create three tables - Users, Doctor, and Appointment - designed to meet the data requirements of each form with appropriate constraints and data types. These tables should be designed to accommodate the specific data requirements of each form, with appropriate data types and constraints applied as necessary.
Users can sign up, search for doctors, view availability, book appointments, update information, view appointment history, and cancel appointments. MUALIJ provides a user-friendly interface and efficient performance. By following these steps, you can start using MUALIJ and manage your medical appointments in an easy and time-efficient way.


****TECHNOLOGIES****
HTML, BOOTSTRAP, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJs, NodeJs, MySQL WorkBench

****CHALLENGES FACED****
Challenges in web projects regarding database connectivity and validations include connectivity issues, data validation errors, framework concerns, scalability, and backup planning. Overcoming these challenges required using a robust database management system MySQL, implementing proper data validation techniques, ensuring strong database security, and regular testing and monitoring.
